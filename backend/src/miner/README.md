# Miner

## TODO

- Each turtle is allocated segments to mine
- Hard-coded Y axis
- Consistently spreads out from a central point
- Refueling
- Go back to chests, dump out collected minerals
- "Miners" and "Collectors?" Alternating jobs for the turtles
  - Miners will transform into collectors when their inventory is full
  - Collectors will transform into miners when their inventory has been emptied

### Start function

- Server initializes a "miner session" containing data about the ongoing session
